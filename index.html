            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As an aspiring data scientist and engineer, I am always looking for new and innovative ways to use
                data to understand and solve complex problems. One area that particularly interests me is environmental
                science, and in particular the use of remote sensing techniques to study and monitor the Earth's surface
                and atmosphere. I am currently about to graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, where I
                have been able to gain a strong foundation in data science and machine learning through my coursework
                and research experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also had the opportunity to gain practical experience in my
                field through internships and research assistantships. Most recently, I had the privilege of serving as
                a NASA intern, where I worked on a project using satellite data to optimize satellite navigation through
                knowledge graphs.
                I have also had the opportunity to work as a research assistant in the ESPM department at
                UC Berkeley, where I have been able to work closely with Dr. Manuela Girotto on a variety of
                data-driven research projects. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in the skills and
                knowledge that I need to succeed as a data scientist and data engineer, and have sparked a passion in me
                for using data to tackle important environmental challenges.

                    <h3>Research Assistant | UC Berkeley ESPM Department</h3>
                    Working in the Girotto Lab under Dr. Manuela Girotto I collect, organize, and preprocess data from remote sensing instruments, such as satellite or aerial imagery.
                    I analyze data using statistical and machine learning techniques to extract insights and inform decision-making.
                    I also collaborate with the environmental engineers and other researchers at UC Berkeley and NASA to identify research questions and develop data-driven solutions.
                    I present findings and recommendations to the research team and other stakeholders through written reports and oral presentations.
                    I also stay up-to-date with the latest research and developments in the field of remote sensing and data science, and
                    participate in research meetings and contributing to the development of research proposals.

                            This was a research project sponsored by the UC Berkeley Discovery Program and overseen by 
                            Central Sierra Snow Lab atmospheric scientist Dr. Andrew Schwartz. The purpose of this project was 
                            to use a ML model and data science techniques to find a connection between historic ocean temperature 
                            data and how that affected the levels of precipitation in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

                <p></p>
                    The goal of this project is to use historical ocean temperature and anomaly data to predict precipitation 
                    levels in the Tahoe region of California. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
                    (PDO), and Arctic Oscillation (AO) cause the amplitude of the jetstream to effect precipitation patterns 
                    directly north or directly south of this region, but it is unclear whether or not this affects the Tahoe 
                    region. This project uses a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to predict precipitation levels 
                    solely using the ocean temperature data, and is able to do so with remarkable accuracy.
                    <p></p>
                    Data was collected from the following sources.
                    <p></p>
                    SNOTEL: https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/tabget?state=CA
                    <p></p>
                    ENSO: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/sstoi.indices
                    <p></p>
                    PDO: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/ersst/v5/index/ersst.v5.pdo.dat
                    <p></p>
                    AO: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/daily_ao_index/monthly.ao.index.b50.current.ascii.table
                    <p></p>
                    The data is pulled on a given interval and that will ensure that our model is always up to 
                    date on historical precipitation levels. Autocorrelation and Seasonal Decomposition were used 
                    to find correlation between the oscillation data and the accumulated precipitation levels in 
                    the SNOTEL dataset.
